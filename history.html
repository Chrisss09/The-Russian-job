                            Russia was ruled by the Romanov's for 300 years from the very first Tsar Michael to Peter 
                            the Great and to the final Tsar Nicholas II. Please take a look below into the wonderful

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>St. Basil's Cathedral</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow, 
                        was built by Ivan the Terrible between 1555 and 1561. According to legend, the builder of this cathedral was blinded so that such a beautiful s
                        tructure could never be built again. The cathedral is vividly colorful and contains redbrick towers that add to 
                        its beauty. The church’s design consists of nine chapels, each mounted with its individual dome that marks the 
                        assault on the city of Kazan. The design of St. Basil’s Cathedral provides strong religious symbolism and is based on 
                        architectural designs found in Jerusalem. Eight of the domes make a circular formation around the ninth dome, which looks like a star when 
                        viewed from the top. There is a deep contrast between the interior and the exterior of the St. Basil’s Cathedral. 
                        The interior contains modest decorations and the corridors are narrow, leaving little space for seating worshippers.
                        In one legend, the French ruler Napoleon even wanted to take St. Basil’s Cathedral back to 
                        France with him, but due to the lack of such technology, he ordered his army to destroy it so 
                        that no one else could occupy it. His army had prepared to attack the church and had also lit 
                        up the gunpowder, but a mysterious rain shower prevented any explosions from occurring.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">The Assumption Cathedral is situated at the Cathedral Square, 
                        surrounded by Old Russian architecture: cathedrals and churches, the Ivan the Great 
                        Bell-Tower, the Facets Palace and the Patriarch’s Palace. The cathedral is dedicated to the 
                        Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary and was built as the principal 
                        church of the Russian state. In 1326, currently, Grand Prince of Muscovy Ivan Kalita launched 
                        the construction of the cathedral. A new building was constructed in 1479 by decree of Grand 
                        Prince of Russia Ivan III, who consolidated all Russian princedoms under the power of Moscow. 
                        A renowned architect Aristotele Fioravanti of Bologna was invited to Russia to design and to 
                        build it. Considered to be the principal church of Russia, the cathedral surpassed all the earlier 
                        churches both in size and splendour of its interior. Outstanding painters from all over the country 
                        were invited to paint walls and icons in the cathedral. Eventually, it gained rich and truly a 
                        unique collection of Russian medieval art monuments, which has been carefully maintained and 
                        multiplied over the centuries. After the Revolution of 1917, the cathedral was turned 
                        into a museum. 
                        From 1990 onwards, divine services were resumed in the Assumption Cathedral.

                        in learning more about Russian history. Opened in 1894, the museum was the result of a 20-year 
                        project to consolidate multiple archaeological and anthropological collections into a single 
                        museum. Set just off Red Square in a large Russian Revivalist building, the museum is home to 
                        more than four million objects covering 1,000 years of Russian history and the history of 
                        northeastern Eurasian civilizations. Exhibits are presented mostly chronologically across 39 
                        rooms, each of which focuses on a different era or region, such as Eastern Europe and Asia in 
                        the Middle Ages, the Old Russian State in the 9th to 12th Centuries, Craft and Trade in the 
                        16th and 17th centuries, the era of Catherine the Great, the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian 
                        culture in the early 20th century. The entire second floor is devoted to Russia’s imperial period, 
                        with many personal items, palace decorations and furnishings on display. Other highlights include 
                        Scythian gold figures, funerary masks from Russia’s Altai region and the death mask of Peter the

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>Bolshoi Theatre</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">This is one of the world’s 
                        biggest opera and ballet theaters, rated as high as La Scala in Italy and Covent Garden in 
                        England. It is hard to overestimate the importance of the Bolshoi Theater for Russia. You can 
                        only enjoy its immortal creations and to admire its magnificent building, which is also an 
                        outstanding example of Russian architecture. The Bolshoi Theater in Moscow is one of the best 
                        theater buildings in the world. Five-tier house is renowned for its size and excellent 
                        acoustics. It is decorated with gilded stucco, murals on the ceiling, and huge tiered crystal 
                        chandelier. The height of the housel is 21 meters, its length - 25 meters, width - 26 meters. 
                        It seats 2,153 spectators. In front of the Bolshoi Theater there is the square with a fountain. 
                        And yet, the chronology of the Bolshoi Theater begins in 1776. The Bolshoi is by right called the pride 
                        of Russian culture. Throughout its existence it was the center of attraction of the best Russian 
                        opera and ballet. The stage of this theater was first to see many outstanding works of Russian 
                        composers; its company consists of the most famous local singers, dancers, conductors, directors, 
                        and choreographers. The glory of the Bolshoi Theater has long gone beyond the limits of our 
                        country.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>The Kremlin</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">Moscow's history began around 1147, when Yuri 
                        Dolgoruky, Grand Duke of Kiev, built a wooden fort at the point where the Neglina and Moskva 
                        Rivers converge. Under Ivan the Great (1462 - 1505), the Kremlin became the centre of a unified
                        Russian state. Meanwhile, Moscow spread outside the walls of the citadel, and the Kremlin 
                        became a world apart, the base of the twin powers of state and religion. This period saw the 
                        construction of the magnificent Cathedrals of the Assumption, the Annunciation and the 
                        Archangel, and the uniquely Russian Terem Palace, the royal residence and the addition of the 
                        Ivan the Great Bell Tower. Ivan's descendants further developed and adapted the Kremlin complex 
                        and, even when Peter the Great moved the capital to St Petersburg, Russia's rulers continued to 
                        leave their mark on the medieval town. Peter himself built the Kremlin Arsenal, originally planned 
                        as a military museum and now occupied by a barracks, and the 18th and 19th centuries brought 
                        Neoclassical masterpieces such as the Senate Building and the Great Kremlin Palace. After the 1917 
                        Revolution, the Kremlin regained its rightful place as the seat of the Russian government, and the 
                        legacy of the Communist era is still visible in the large red stars that top many of the defensive 
                        towers.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>Izvestia</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">The newspaper began as the News of the 
                        Petrograd Soviet of Workers Deputies on 13th March 1917 in St. Petersburg and was the main newspaper of the revolutionaries.
                        During the Soviet period, while Pravda (who was a competitor) served as the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, 
                        Izvestia expressed the official views of the Soviet government as published by the Presidium of the 
                        Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The full name was Izvestiya Sovetov Narodnykh Deputatov SSSR.
                        As fighting raged in the streets of Petrograd, a small group of 
                        revolutionaries seized a printing office and changed Russian journalistic history. That night, 
                        they started to work. “We got down to writing,” Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich, a Bolshevik and 
                        close associate of Lenin who was one of the leaders of the group, recalled in his memoirs. 
                        “Everyone penned a few articles. Everything we wrote we read out to each other straight 
                        away and then, without any self-importance, discarded the worst.” 
                        Izvestia is now a national newspaper of Russia and now, as Russia commemorates 100 years since 
                        the tumultuous events that swept away the monarchy and paved the way for the Bolshevik seizure
                        of power, Izvestia is marking its centenary. No other Russian newspaper has been in continual 
                        publication for so long.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>Lenin's Mausoleum</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">The Mausoleum of Lenin is 
                        not just a tomb: for the Soviet regime, it became a monument on a nationwide scale, a representation of public 
                        gratitude, and an illustrative symbol of the fact that Lenin’s cause remained alive. The Soviet leaders made 
                        political statements and inspected parades from its surrounds. Every member of the Communist party considered it 
                        their duty to visit Red Square Mausoleum to pay tribute to their leader. In 1953, Stalin’s corpse was placed there 
                        too, though only for a short period of time though: it was removed and buried in 1961 as part of de-Stalinisation. 
                        Thus, the mausoleum was named the ‘Lenin and Stalin Mausoleum’ between 1953 and 1961.
                        While the mausoleum is comparatively small from the outside, it has hidden depths. There are two 
                        underground floors to the structure, which used to house a rest area for VIPs and the Kremlin 
                        guards, and the laboratory that was once used to supervise the ongoing embalming process. Sadly, 
                        though apparently no longer used, they aren't open to the public. If you do wish to see the body, 
                        you will join the queue that runs along the Kremlin wall and you can enjoy a nice walk around the Garden
                        and then when you get to the entrance it is very dark and cold, and you will proceed to go down and around
                        Lenin's body.</p>

                        St. Petersburg, and thus the birthplace of the city, it never served its intended defensive function. Instead it 
                        has had a rich, hugely varied, and sometimes sinister history as a military base, a home of government departments, 
                        the burial ground of the Russian Imperial family, the site of groundbreaking scientific experiments, and a 
                        forbidding jail that held some of Russia's most prominent political prisoners.
                        Today, the Peter and Paul Fortress is for the most part under the auspices of the St. Petersburg Museum of History, 
                        with a number of permanent and temporary exhibitions charting the various aspects of the compound's past. Peter and Paul Cathedral, one of St. Petersburg's most 
                        striking buildings, there is plenty within the walls of the fortress to keep children and adults occupied for a 
                        full day at least. The Peter and Paul Fortress is also the centre of a number of St. Petersburg urban traditions, 
                        among them the daily firing of the cannon from the Naryshkin Bastion at noon and the "walruses" who use the beach 
                        in front of the fortress to sunbathe and swim in ice-holes in the winter. In the summer, the beach is a popular 
                        picnic site and is also used to host a variety of events, festivals and concerts, including the respected Petrojazz 
                        annual festival.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>Peter the Great's cabin</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">The first residential building 
                        to be built in the newly founded city of St. Petersburg was a wooden house or cabin, intended 
                        for Tsar Peter himself. The cabin is very small - only 60 square meters in area and is a 
                        strange combination of a traditional Russian house or izba and a Dutch home with large and 
                        elaborate windows and a high roof covered with wooden tiles. Tsar Peter lived in this house 
                        between 1703 and 1708 and the living room, bedroom and study, still filled with Peter's 
                        original belongings, continue to bear the mark of his presence. Peter the Great wanted all the
                        houses of his new city to be built of stone, the way it was done in Europe. But he could not 
                        afford a stone house at the time, so he ordered the walls to be painted as if the house was 
                        made of bricks. Hidden from wind and rain inside a red brick pavilion, the first house built 
                        in the city of St. Petersburg is still open to the public. During the Second World War the 
                        Cabin of Peter the Great was the first museum to reopen in 1944 after the dramatic 900-day 
                        Siege of Leningrad.</p>

                        He came from a very humble background, but was quickly promoted by Peter to become a duke 
                        (1707) and the Governor General of St. Petersburg. Under his supervision the Peter and Paul 
                        Fortress and the fort of Kronshlot (now Kronshtadt) in the Gulf of Finland were built. Being 
                        the Governor General, he commissioned a large palace on Vasilievsky Island, where he lived 
                        until 1727. The palace was the most luxurious house to be built in the city thus far (far 
                        superior to the Summer Palace of Peter the Great) and was therefore chosen to host various 
                        official functions. After Peter's death in 1725, Menshikov did his best to ensure that 
                        the throne would pass safely to Peter's wife Catherine I. For two years Menshikov effectively 
                        ruled the country. In 1727, a few weeks before his daughter's marriage to the heir to the throne, 
                        Menshikov was accused of treason and stealing government money and was exiled with his whole family 
                        to Siberia. Between 1732 and 1918 the palace was home to a military school, but in 1967 it was given to the 
                        Hermitage. Now, with the early 18th century interiors restored, it houses a collection of Russian cultural 
                        artifacts from the early 18th century.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>Literary Museum</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">Literature is the most complete and expressive manifestation of the Russian 
                        creative genius. It conveys not only aesthetic, moral and spiritual values and beliefs; 
                        literature is also our philosophy, the way to get insight into life, as leading Russian 
                        philosophers note. Great Russian poets and writers have always been the voice of this people's 
                        conscience and soul, and had to suffer for it. The priority of literature in the cultural 
                        life of the Russian people can be explained by its origin and the meaning it got from the 
                        moment of its appearance. Written language and literature were introduced to Russia from the 
                        outside, along with Christianity. Books appeared in Russia in the form of a sacred scripture, 
                        thus determining the place and role of literature in the history of Russian culture. Yet, one 
                        should not forget about the riches of folk creativity, the vivid source of primordial 
                        knowledge and inspiration for men of letters and thinkers of all times. The language and 
                        spirit of folk poetry in the form of songs, fairy tales, epics, etc. introduced genuine life 
                        and imagery to Russian literature. Enter the Literary Museum on Vasilyevsky Island and discover
                        the best collections of the golden era of Russian literature from the 19th century.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12"><h3>Winter Palace</h3><p style="font-size:15px;text-align:justify">Several different 
                        palaces were constructed in the 18th century, with the fourth and final version built in 
                        1754–62 by Baroque architect Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrelli; it was restored following a fire 
                        in 1837, though the destroyed interior was largely redesigned. The palace is now part of the 
                        Hermitage museum. The first Winter Palace was constructed in 1708 for Peter I. In the early 1730s, 
                        Rastrelli was commissioned by Empress Anna to design a bigger residence, 
                        and it was finished in 1735. Elizabeth subsequently requested renovations to create a palace 
                        of unparalled opulence, and Rastrelli ultimately designed a new building that was to become a 
                        masterpiece of Russian Baroque architecture. Work began in 1754, with more than 4,000 people 
                        involved in the construction of the 460-room structure. Completed in 1762, the fourth Winter 
                        Palace became known for its elegance and luxury. The three-story building was built around a 
                        quadrangle, and although each of the four facades were unique, they all featured white columns 
                        against a sandy pink background, with golden stucco moldings. The 176 sculptured figures that 
                        lined the roof added to the palace’s striking appearance. After Catherine II assumed the throne 
                        in 1762, she dismissed Rastrelli and had much of the Baroque interior replaced with Neoclassical 
                        designs. In 1837 the building’s interior was destroyed by a fire, and four years later restoration 
                        work was completed. Although the Neoclassical look was retained, many new designs were introduced; 
                        the slightly damaged exterior, however, was rebuilt according to Rastrelli’s plans. Painted various 
                        colours over the years, the current palace’s exterior is largely green and white. 
                        After Nicholas II was overthrown during the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Winter Palace 
                        became a museum.</p>

                        Versailles was the inspiration for Peter the Great's desire to build an imperial palace in 
                        the suburbs of his new city and, after an aborted attempt at Strelna, Peterhof - which means 
                        "Peter's Court" in German - became the site for the Tsar's Monplaisir Palace, and then of the 
                        original Grand Palace. The estate was equally popular with Peter's daughter, Empress 
                        Elizabeth, who ordered the expansion of the Grand Palace and greatly extended the park and the 
                        famous system of fountains, including the truly spectacular Grand Cascade.
                        Improvements to the park continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Catherine the 
                        Great, after leaving her own mark on the park, moved the court to Pushkin, but Peterhof once 
                        again became the official Imperial Residence in the reign of Nicholas I, who ordered the 
                        building of the modest Cottage Palace in 1826.
                        Like almost all St. Petersburg's suburban estates, Peterhof was ravaged by German troops 
                        during the Second World War. It was, however, one of the first to be resurrected and, thanks 
                        to the work of military engineers as well as over 1,000 volunteers, the Lower Park opened to 
                        the public in 1945 and the facades of the Grand Palace were restored in 1952. The name was 
                        also de-Germanicized in 1944, becoming Petrodvorets, the name under which the surrounding town 
                        is still known. The palace and park are once again known as Peterhof.</p>

                        In 1830, the palace was purchased by Prince Nikolay Borisovich Yusupov, and it remained in the 
                        ownership of the family until seized by the Bolsheviks in 1917. The legends surrounding 
                        Rasputin's murder, which took place in the basement of the Yusupov Palace on 16 December 1916, 
                        are mostly based on the sensationalist account in the autobiography of Prince Felix Yusupov, 
                        who claimed to have led the plotters in first poisoning, then shooting, then beating Rasputin 
                        with clubs and throwing him into the icy Malaya Nevka River, where the Mad Monk eventually died 
                        of hypothermia. There is now a display in the palace museum that uses photography, documents, 
                        and wax figures to recreate the assassination and the following investigation.
                        After the October Revolution, the palace was handed to the educational authorities, 
                        which fortunately opted to preserve many of the original interiors and used the building as a 
                        type of clubhouse for the city's teachers. As well as the Rasputin display,
                         the modern museum offers guests 
                        the chance to explore the reception rooms and living quarters on the ground floor of the 
                        palace. The Yusupov Palace also functions as a 
                        cultural centre, hosting classical concerts and theatre performances in the beautiful rococo 
                        Palace Theatre and the equally impressive White-Columns Hall.</p>
