                            Russia was ruled by the Romanov's for 300 years from the very first Tsar Michael to Peter 
                            the Great and to the final Tsar Nicholas II. Please take a look below into the wonderful

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>St. Basil's Cathedral</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow, 
                        was built by Ivan the Terrible between 1555 and 1561. According to legend, the builder of this cathedral was blinded so that such a beautiful s
                        tructure could never be built again. The cathedral is vividly colorful and contains redbrick towers that add to 
                        its beauty. The church’s design consists of nine chapels, each mounted with its individual dome that marks the 
                        assault on the city of Kazan. The design of St. Basil’s Cathedral provides strong religious symbolism and is based on 
                        architectural designs found in Jerusalem. Eight of the domes make a circular formation around the ninth dome, which looks like a star when 
                        viewed from the top. There is a deep contrast between the interior and the exterior of the St. Basil’s Cathedral. 
                        The interior contains modest decorations and the corridors are narrow, leaving little space for seating worshippers.
                        In one legend, the French ruler Napoleon even wanted to take St. Basil’s Cathedral back to 
                        France with him, but due to the lack of such technology, he ordered his army to destroy it so 
                        that no one else could occupy it. His army had prepared to attack the church and had also lit 
                        up the gunpowder, but a mysterious rain shower prevented any explosions from occurring.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">The Assumption Cathedral is situated at the Cathedral Square, 
                        surrounded by Old Russian architecture: cathedrals and churches, the Ivan the Great 
                        Bell-Tower, the Facets Palace and the Patriarch’s Palace. The cathedral is dedicated to the 
                        Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary and was built as the principal 
                        church of the Russian state. In 1326, currently, Grand Prince of Muscovy Ivan Kalita launched 
                        the construction of the cathedral. A new building was constructed in 1479 by decree of Grand 
                        Prince of Russia Ivan III, who consolidated all Russian princedoms under the power of Moscow. 
                        A renowned architect Aristotele Fioravanti of Bologna was invited to Russia to design and to 
                        build it. Considered to be the principal church of Russia, the cathedral surpassed all the earlier 
                        churches both in size and splendour of its interior. Outstanding painters from all over the country 
                        were invited to paint walls and icons in the cathedral. Eventually, it gained rich and truly a 
                        unique collection of Russian medieval art monuments, which has been carefully maintained and 
                        multiplied over the centuries. After the Revolution of 1917, the cathedral was turned 
                        into a museum. 
                        From 1990 onwards, divine services were resumed in the Assumption Cathedral.

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>State Historical Museum</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">The State Historical Museum in Moscow is a must for anyone interested 
                        in learning more about Russian history. Opened in 1894, the museum was the result of a 20-year 
                        project to consolidate multiple archaeological and anthropological collections into a single 
                        museum. Set just off Red Square in a large Russian Revivalist building, the museum is home to 
                        more than four million objects covering 1,000 years of Russian history and the history of 
                        northeastern Eurasian civilizations. Exhibits are presented mostly chronologically across 39 
                        rooms, each of which focuses on a different era or region, such as Eastern Europe and Asia in 
                        the Middle Ages, the Old Russian State in the 9th to 12th Centuries, Craft and Trade in the 
                        16th and 17th centuries, the era of Catherine the Great, the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian 
                        culture in the early 20th century. The entire second floor is devoted to Russia’s imperial period, 
                        with many personal items, palace decorations and furnishings on display. Other highlights include 
                        Scythian gold figures, funerary masks from Russia’s Altai region and the death mask of Peter the 
                        Great.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>Bolshoi Theatre</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">This is one of the world’s 
                        biggest opera and ballet theaters, rated as high as La Scala in Italy and Covent Garden in 
                        England. It is hard to overestimate the importance of the Bolshoi Theater for Russia. You can 
                        only enjoy its immortal creations and to admire its magnificent building, which is also an 
                        outstanding example of Russian architecture. The Bolshoi Theater in Moscow is one of the best 
                        theater buildings in the world. Five-tier house is renowned for its size and excellent 
                        acoustics. It is decorated with gilded stucco, murals on the ceiling, and huge tiered crystal 
                        chandelier. The height of the housel is 21 meters, its length - 25 meters, width - 26 meters. 
                        It seats 2,153 spectators. In front of the Bolshoi Theater there is the square with a fountain. 
                        And yet, the chronology of the Bolshoi Theater begins in 1776. The Bolshoi is by right called the pride 
                        of Russian culture. Throughout its existence it was the center of attraction of the best Russian 
                        opera and ballet. The stage of this theater was first to see many outstanding works of Russian 
                        composers; its company consists of the most famous local singers, dancers, conductors, directors, 
                        and choreographers. The glory of the Bolshoi Theater has long gone beyond the limits of our 
                        country.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>The Kremlin</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">Moscow's history began around 1147, when Yuri 
                        Dolgoruky, Grand Duke of Kiev, built a wooden fort at the point where the Neglina and Moskva 
                        Rivers converge. Under Ivan the Great (1462 - 1505), the Kremlin became the centre of a unified
                        Russian state. Meanwhile, Moscow spread outside the walls of the citadel, and the Kremlin 
                        became a world apart, the base of the twin powers of state and religion. This period saw the 
                        construction of the magnificent Cathedrals of the Assumption, the Annunciation and the 
                        Archangel, and the uniquely Russian Terem Palace, the royal residence and the addition of the 
                        Ivan the Great Bell Tower. Ivan's descendants further developed and adapted the Kremlin complex 
                        and, even when Peter the Great moved the capital to St Petersburg, Russia's rulers continued to 
                        leave their mark on the medieval town. Peter himself built the Kremlin Arsenal, originally planned 
                        as a military museum and now occupied by a barracks, and the 18th and 19th centuries brought 
                        Neoclassical masterpieces such as the Senate Building and the Great Kremlin Palace. After the 1917 
                        Revolution, the Kremlin regained its rightful place as the seat of the Russian government, and the 
                        legacy of the Communist era is still visible in the large red stars that top many of the defensive 
                        towers.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>Izvestia</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">The newspaper began as the News of the 
                        Petrograd Soviet of Workers Deputies on 13th March 1917 in St. Petersburg and was the main newspaper of the revolutionaries.
                        During the Soviet period, while Pravda (who was a competitor) served as the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, 
                        Izvestia expressed the official views of the Soviet government as published by the Presidium of the 
                        Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The full name was Izvestiya Sovetov Narodnykh Deputatov SSSR.
                        As fighting raged in the streets of Petrograd, a small group of 
                        revolutionaries seized a printing office and changed Russian journalistic history. That night, 
                        they started to work. “We got down to writing,” Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich, a Bolshevik and 
                        close associate of Lenin who was one of the leaders of the group, recalled in his memoirs. 
                        “Everyone penned a few articles. Everything we wrote we read out to each other straight 
                        away and then, without any self-importance, discarded the worst.” 
                        Izvestia is now a national newspaper of Russia and now, as Russia commemorates 100 years since 
                        the tumultuous events that swept away the monarchy and paved the way for the Bolshevik seizure
                        of power, Izvestia is marking its centenary. No other Russian newspaper has been in continual 
                        publication for so long.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>Lenin's Mausoleum</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">The Mausoleum of Lenin is 
                        not just a tomb: for the Soviet regime, it became a monument on a nationwide scale, a representation of public 
                        gratitude, and an illustrative symbol of the fact that Lenin’s cause remained alive. The Soviet leaders made 
                        political statements and inspected parades from its surrounds. Every member of the Communist party considered it 
                        their duty to visit Red Square Mausoleum to pay tribute to their leader. In 1953, Stalin’s corpse was placed there 
                        too, though only for a short period of time though: it was removed and buried in 1961 as part of de-Stalinisation. 
                        Thus, the mausoleum was named the ‘Lenin and Stalin Mausoleum’ between 1953 and 1961.
                        While the mausoleum is comparatively small from the outside, it has hidden depths. There are two 
                        underground floors to the structure, which used to house a rest area for VIPs and the Kremlin 
                        guards, and the laboratory that was once used to supervise the ongoing embalming process. Sadly, 
                        though apparently no longer used, they aren't open to the public. If you do wish to see the body, 
                        you will join the queue that runs along the Kremlin wall and you can enjoy a nice walk around the Garden
                        and then when you get to the entrance it is very dark and cold, and you will proceed to go down and around
                        Lenin's body.</p>
