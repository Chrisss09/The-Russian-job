                        <p style="font-size:15px;">The history of Russia is some of the greatest and the most interesting of all history. 
                            Russia was ruled by the Romanov's for 300 years from the very first Tsar Michael to Peter the Great and to the 
                            final Tsar Nicholas II. After some bad mistakes by Tsar Nicholas II, in the background you had the rising 
                            popularity of the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin, the tides changed and caused a shift in sides. 
                            In 1917 after 300 years and countless attempts at assassinations on the Romanovs, the February revolution began 
                            and the Romanov's were arrested and exiled to their eventual deaths.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:15px;">The Bolsheviks didn't take over straight away, it became a free for all and Alexander 
                            Kerensky took over under the Provisional Government. Whilst all this was happening, Lenin
                            was in exile in Swtitzerland and once he found out he immediately left to get back to 
                            St. Petersburg but with difficulty. Lenin couldn't couldn't get any travel arrangements due to being in the middle of World War 1,
                            so with his fellow exile members they cut a deal with the Germans, and this is known as being
                            Lenin's famous and dangerous train journey. The train jorney was dangerous because the only route they
                            could take was to go into Germany first where the Russian's were in the middle of the war with the Germans.
                            This journey took Lenin and his men over 7 days to get back into St. Petersburg. </p>
                        <p style="font-size:15px;">Moscow and St Petersburg have each been the capital of Russia at various times.
                            To begin with, Peter himself chose the site of the new city, laying the foundation stone for 
                            the Peter Paul Fortress and the city at its walls in May 1703.
                            According to one legend, Peter and his associates were boating around the Neva Delta, 
                            inspecting various islands. He came ashore on Zaychiy Ostrov (Hare Island), and suddenly noticed an eagle soaring 
                            high in the sky above him (the eagle, in double-headed form, is a symbol of the Russian government). 
                            This was interpreted as a good omen and the Tsar gave the command to build the fortress at this spot. 
                            Accidentally or intentionally, the location of the fortress was also strategically important, 
                            blocking the Neva's entrance to enemy fleets. Peter the Great had visited Western Europe 
                            and begun to dream of building a magnificent city along European lines. 
                        <p style="font-size:15px;">The earliest structures in the new city were humble in comparison to his grandiose plans. 
                            Petersburg is unique in that it has retained its first residential house. Only a few days after the official 
                            founding of the city, a small wooden cottage, combining elements of both Russian and Dutch architecture, 
                            was built for Peter, and has become famous as the Cabin of Peter the Great. The Tsar planned to construct a 
                            city of brick and stone, but as there were no brick factories anywhere in the vicinity, the Tsar ordered 
                            the cottage to be painted with red with white detailing in imitation of brickwork, as a form of visual 
                            instruction and admonition to the new city's inhabitants. The Cabin of Peter the Great still stands on the 
                            Petrovskaya Embankment, where within a protective brick pavilion one can view both the cabin and the 
                            personal belongings that Peter kept with him during the early days of the city's construction.
                            Peter the Great ruled Russia until his death in 1725 after fighting many great wars including the big battle
                            against Sweden and their ruler King Charles XII in the war known as the Great Northern War.
                            When Peter died his 2nd wife Catherine I took over and this began her reign.
                        <p style="font-size:15px;">During the reign of Alexander II he was assasinated by terroists, they threw a bomb
                            and it exploded under his horse and carriage, leaving him fatally wounded. He was then carried to the Peter Paul Fortress
                            where he eventually died and you can visit the fortress and see the Tsars preserved uniform afteer the explosion.
                            Alexander III was next inline to become the Tsar and he was one of the most beloved Tsar's and tallest in history.
                            After his steamy affair with the Danish Empress they got married and had a child who 
                            eventually took over as the final Tsar and became Tsar Nicholas II.
                            Tsar Alexander III was the target to several assasinations including the one made by a young
                            scientist Alexander Ulyanov   </p>
