                            Russia was ruled by the Romanov's for 300 years from the very first Tsar Michael to Peter 
                            the Great and to the final Tsar Nicholas II. Please take a look below into the wonderful

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>St. Basil's Cathedral</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow, 
                        was built by Ivan the Terrible between 1555 and 1561. According to legend, the builder of this cathedral was blinded so that such a beautiful s
                        tructure could never be built again. The cathedral is vividly colorful and contains redbrick towers that add to 
                        its beauty. The church’s design consists of nine chapels, each mounted with its individual dome that marks the 
                        assault on the city of Kazan. The design of St. Basil’s Cathedral provides strong religious symbolism and is based on 
                        architectural designs found in Jerusalem. Eight of the domes make a circular formation around the ninth dome, which looks like a star when 
                        viewed from the top. There is a deep contrast between the interior and the exterior of the St. Basil’s Cathedral. 
                        The interior contains modest decorations and the corridors are narrow, leaving little space for seating worshippers.
                        In one legend, the French ruler Napoleon even wanted to take St. Basil’s Cathedral back to 
                        France with him, but due to the lack of such technology, he ordered his army to destroy it so 
                        that no one else could occupy it. His army had prepared to attack the church and had also lit 
                        up the gunpowder, but a mysterious rain shower prevented any explosions from occurring.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><h3>Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin</h3><p style="font-size:15px;">The Assumption Cathedral is situated at the Cathedral Square, 
                        surrounded by Old Russian architecture: cathedrals and churches, the Ivan the Great 
                        Bell-Tower, the Facets Palace and the Patriarch’s Palace. The cathedral is dedicated to the 
                        Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary and was built as the principal 
                        church of the Russian state. In 1326, currently, Grand Prince of Muscovy Ivan Kalita launched 
                        the construction of the cathedral. A new building was constructed in 1479 by decree of Grand 
                        Prince of Russia Ivan III, who consolidated all Russian princedoms under the power of Moscow. 
                        A renowned architect Aristotele Fioravanti of Bologna was invited to Russia to design and to 
                        build it. Considered to be the principal church of Russia, the cathedral surpassed all the earlier 
                        churches both in size and splendour of its interior. Outstanding painters from all over the country 
                        were invited to paint walls and icons in the cathedral. Eventually, it gained rich and truly a 
                        unique collection of Russian medieval art monuments, which has been carefully maintained and 
                        multiplied over the centuries. After the Revolution of 1917, the cathedral was turned 
                        into a museum. 
                        From 1990 onwards, divine services were resumed in the Assumption Cathedral.

                        in learning more about Russian history. Opened in 1894, the museum was the result of a 20-year 
                        project to consolidate multiple archaeological and anthropological collections into a single 
                        museum. Set just off Red Square in a large Russian Revivalist building, the museum is home to 
                        more than four million objects covering 1,000 years of Russian history and the history of 
                        northeastern Eurasian civilizations. Exhibits are presented mostly chronologically across 39 
                        rooms, each of which focuses on a different era or region, such as Eastern Europe and Asia in 
                        the Middle Ages, the Old Russian State in the 9th to 12th Centuries, Craft and Trade in the 
                        16th and 17th centuries, the era of Catherine the Great, the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian 
                        culture in the early 20th century. The entire second floor is devoted to Russia’s imperial period, 
                        with many personal items, palace decorations and furnishings on display. Other highlights include 
                        Scythian gold figures, funerary masks from Russia’s Altai region and the death mask of Peter the 
                        Great.</p>
