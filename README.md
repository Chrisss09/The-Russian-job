<h1>Russian Empire</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website on the very best of Russia, I have created this website as a travel guide to show people how great Russia is. This site will show you how amazing and beautiful places are with it's rich history and great sites. This will help you get an idea of what you can do and see and some history information to back it up. Russia is one of my passions, I have read many books on the history of Russia, I have been to both Moscow and St. Petersburg a number of times and the photos used on my website are all my own.</p>
<p>My love of Russia all started by accidentally buying a book of Rasputin and ever since then I have been obsessed so based on my love of Russia and my own experiences I wanted to show people how amazing Russia is as statistics show not many people from the UK know much about the subject.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>I have designed and created my website for users who want to get to know Russia, the user may not know much about this country and it's beautiful scenery, So I have created this site with some beautiful photos and a wide range of information.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Homepage - I have created a clear and fun homepage with a lot of great photos and clear text.
<li>Top navbar - On my top navbar I have created very clear links through my website.
<li>Due to a lot of content I have made my navbar fixed to the top of the screen to allow the user easy access to get from one page to another
