<h1>Russian Empire</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website on the very best of Russia, I have created this website as a travel guide to show people how great Russia is. This site will show you how amazing and beautiful places are with it's rich history and great sites. This will help you get an idea of what you can do and see and some history information to back it up. Russia is one of my passions, I have read many books on the history of Russia, I have been to both Moscow and St. Petersburg a number of times and the photos used on my website are all my own.</p>
<p>My love of Russia all started by accidentally buying a book of Rasputin and ever since then I have been obsessed so based on my love of Russia and my own experiences I wanted to show people how amazing Russia is as statistics show not many people from the UK know much about the subject.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>I have designed and created my website for users who want to get to know Russia, the user may not know much about this country and it's beautiful scenery, So I have created this site with some beautiful photos and a wide range of information.</p>
<p>The colour scheme I have chosen as part of the Russian flag so everything matches the Russian colours.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Homepage - I have created a clear and fun homepage with a lot of great photos and clear text.
<li>Top navbar - On my top navbar I have created very clear links through my website.
<li>Due to a lot of content I have made my navbar fixed to the top of the screen to allow the user easy access to get from one page to another.
<li>Using my fixed navbar I have added an 'active' class which will remind the user what page they are using. 
<li>Using my photos on my homepage I have created links to additional content and links to my pages on my navbar.
<li>In this project I have added in two modals: One of them is in my navbar, under 'Login in/sign up'. When the user clicks on that button the modal will appear and the user will not be allowed to proceed without their password. The other modal I have used under my Jumbotron, where the user can enter their details for an itinery.
<li>I have also used Youtube videos on several of my pages. I have done this by using the embeded option on Youtube and added the code into my HTML, and then I styled it using my CSS sheet.
<li>I have made my website mobile responsive by using various media queries and once my website is on a mobile device my navbar will collapse into the burger menu, this will allow the user to click on it and they can then choose what page they would like to click on.
<li>When the user views my website on a mobile device they will notice I have changed the colour to my collapsed menu as the Russian flag by using my CSS codes.
<li>At the bottom of each page I have my footer section which has more information, including the social network links. I have added a transitional function on each of these social network links, so when the user scrolls over them the link will turn blue which will match my colour scheme and also the link will rotate. 
<li>Also on my footer page due to the visa process being very important I have added a link to the external website for visa information.
<li>On my contact page I have also used the 'mailto:' option so that the user can click on it to email the company. 
<p>An additional feature that I would of liked to implement in the future would be a dropdown menu under 'The History of Russia' section, so the dropdown menu would allow the user to select from the list what part of the history they would want to skip down the page to.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>During my first project I have used many different technologies including HTML and CSS to create an effective and professional website for users.</p>
<p>Also included in my website are;</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript and JQuery - I used these to allow my modal to work effectively and I have also used these to make my navbar collapse for mobile devices. The websites these are linked to are: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/ and https://code.jquery.com/
<li>Bootstrap - I have used version 3 of Bootstrap for my Jumbotron and grid layout, to effectively show my images and clear text.
<li>Google Fonts - I have used Google Fonts for my headings and the font I have chosen was Arvo and the link to this is https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arvo
<li>Font Awesome - I have also used Bootstrap's Font Awesome to create my social media icon links: https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started?using=web-fonts-with-css
<li>At the end of each page I have used a warning container to remind the user that it is important to know that you will need a visa to get into Russia.
<li>Images - All my images used on this site are my own but due to the size of them they were large so they were slowing my website down, I downloaded a free image editor program called Photopad Image Editor so I was able to resize my images and compress them to a standard level. I also used a website called TinyPNG which also compresses your photos: https://tinypng.com/
<p>To get my website to a high level I used several websites to research and get more information from, this includes the best places to go, the best food to eat and all the various information on each of the buildings and their history.

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Throughout the project I conducted a number of testing on my website and one of the big issues I struggled with was the file sizes of my images, they were appearing on my website very slowly which is not ideal if a user has slow broadband speed. After investigation by getting advice on Slack and by talking to my mentor, I downloaded a free photo editing programe which is PhotoPad Image Editor and then I could resize my smaller images and also compress them and they now work a lot faster on my website.</p>
<p>At the start of my project I struggled to get a mobile responsive navbar, my HTML coding was correct, and I also used a media query to help me collapse my navbar. After further investigation and by speaking to other students on Slack they advised me to start again and use a Bootstrap navbar. I started my navbar from the start and slightly amended my CSS Stylesheet and added the max width to 1199px and then anything after that my navbar will show fully. By amending my navbar to a Bootstrap navbar, my collapsing navbar worked as it should.</p> 
<p>During the navigation through my website and in particular my 'History of Russia' page I felt like there was a lot of content and it wasn't very user-friendly so I made my navbar fixed to the top so it is easier for the user to navigate through my pages. I also thought, to make it even more user-friendly I added the 'active' class on my navbar. The active class will tell the user what page they are currently on by highlighting red, I have chosen the colour red because that is my colour scheme.</p>
<p>On my navbar I have a 'sign in' page, so when the user clicks on it I have added an important function on both the email address and password, this won't allow the user to proceed if they have not put anything in the boxes. Once a user has added their email and password they can click on the button and they can proceed. Upon testing this I found I was missing a 'Remember me' checkbox, so using Bootstrap I have added this onto each page which will now allow the user to click on the checkbox to remember them.</p> 
<p>I also have a sign up button below my Jumbotron on my homepage, when the user clicks on this it will ask the user to fill in their surename, forename and email address. I have only added the important function on the email address on this one as the email address is the only relevant information we need to know. Upon testing this I thought it would be better to add a textarea box from Bootstrap. I added this just above the submit button with a placeholder to let the user know to tell us any specific details.</p>
<p>After a conversation with my mentor at the end of the project he said that my homepage needs more information and for the user to be able to interact with the homepage more. To expand on this I used some images and created some links to my other pages, so the user can now click on an image and they can go to another page. Also based on our conversation I created two more pages to my website and added the links onto another two of my images on the homepage, so the user can now click on an image and it will take them to the other page I have made.</p>
<p>Also based on the conversation I had with my mentor he wanted me to add more information to the homepage so I created an introduction to my website and also I added on a section to both my Moscow page and St Petersburg page to discuss the best food in Russia.</p> 
<p>I have tested my mobile responsive website and I found something I did not like, this was on my history of Russia page. Using the Bootstrap layout I added col-xs-12 col-sm-6 which looked really good on my desktop and small phone but I didn't like it on tablet due to all the white space it caused, so I changed it to col-xs-12 col-sm-12, which improved this a lot and think it now looks a lot better on a tablet version, as well as mobile and desktop.</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>To deploy my website onto a server I used GitHub and to start off I signed into my GitHub account and created a new repository and called my new project a suitable name. Once that hasa been saved I copied the url link that GitHub gave me and then I opened up Visual Studio Code which is what I am using for my project. On the start up screen I clicked on 'Clone Git Repository' and then I pasted the url into that and then I selected my root folder that I created earlier to start my project. Now I can open up my folder on Visual Studio Code and it is now linked to my GitHub page, and once I make the changes for example add my HTML and CSS coding, I can then open up the terminal in VSC and I can use my Git codes like 'git status', 'git add .' and 'git push' which will send this through to my github repository. I can then use this to save my updates and share my work with others. Also in my settings on my github page I can set it to my master branch which will then give me my url address which means it is now on the World Wide Web.
