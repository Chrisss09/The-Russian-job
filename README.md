<h1>Russian Empire</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website on the very best of Russia, I have created this website as a travel guide to show people how great Russia is. This site will show you how amazing and beautiful places are with it's rich history and great sites. This will help you get an idea of what you can do and see and some history information to back it up. Russia is one of my passions, I have read many books on the history of Russia, I have been to both Moscow and St. Petersburg a number of times and the photos used on my website are all my own.</p>
<p>My love of Russia all started by accidentally buying a book of Rasputin and ever since then I have been obsessed so based on my love of Russia and my own experiences I wanted to show people how amazing Russia is as statistics show not many people from the UK know much about the subject.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>
<p>I have designed and created my website for users who want to get to know Russia, the user may not know much about this country and it's beautiful scenery, So I have created this site with some beautiful photos and a wide range of information.</p>
<p>The colour scheme I have chosen as part of the Russian flag so everything matches the Russian colours.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Homepage - I have created a clear and fun homepage with a lot of great photos and clear text.
<li>Top navbar - On my top navbar I have created very clear links through my website.
<li>Due to a lot of content I have made my navbar fixed to the top of the screen to allow the user easy access to get from one page to another.
<li>Using my fixed navbar I have added an 'active' class which will remind the user what page they are using. 
<li>Using my photos on my homepage I have created links to additional content and links to my pages on my navbar.
<li>In this project I have added in two modals: One of them is in my navbar, under 'Login in/sign up'. When the user clicks on that button the modal will appear and the user will not be allowed to proceed without their password. The other modal I have used under my Jumbotron, where the user can enter their details for an itinery.
<li>I have also used Youtube videos on several of my pages. I have done this by using the embeded option on Youtube and added the code into my HTML, and then I styled it using my CSS sheet.
<li>I have made my website mobile responsive by using various media queries and once my website is on a mobile device my navbar will collapse into the burger menu, this will allow the user to click on it and they can then choose what page they would like to click on.
<li>When the user views my website on a mobile device they will notice I have changed the colour to my collapsed menu as the Russian flag by using my CSS codes.
<li>At the bottom of each page I have my footer section which has more information, including the social network links. I have added a transitional function on each of these social network links, so when the user scrolls over them the link will turn blue which will match my colour scheme and also the link will rotate. 
<li>Also on my footer page due to the visa process being very important I have added a link to the external website for visa information.
<li>On my contact page I have also used the 'mailto:' option so that the user can click on it to email the company. 
<p>An additional feature that I would of liked to implement in the future would be a dropdown menu under 'The History of Russia' section, so the dropdown menu would allow the user to select from the list what part of the history they would want to skip down the page to.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>During my first project I have used many different technologies including HTML and CSS to create an effective and professional website for users.</p>
<p>Also included in my website are;</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript and JQuery - I used these to allow my modal to work effectively and I have also used these to make my navbar collapse for mobile devices. The websites these are linked to are: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/ and https://code.jquery.com/
<li>Bootstrap - I have used version 3 of Bootstrap for my Jumbotron and grid layout, to effectively show my images and clear text.
<li>Google Fonts - I have used Google Fonts for my headings and the font I have chosen was Arvo and the link to this is https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arvo
<li>Font Awesome - I have also used Bootstrap's Font Awesome to create my social media icon links: https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started?using=web-fonts-with-css
<li>At the end of each page I have used a warning container to remind the user that it is important to know that you will need a visa to get into Russia.
<li>Images - All my images used on this site are my own but due to the size of them they were large so they were slowing my website down, I downloaded a free image editor program called Photopad Image Editor so I was able to resize my images and compress them to a standard level. I also used a website called TinyPNG which also compresses your photos: https://tinypng.com/
<li>To get my website to a high level I used several websites to research and get more information from, this includes the best places to go, the best food to eat and all the various information on each of the buildings and their history.
