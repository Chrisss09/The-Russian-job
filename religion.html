                    <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:justify">Despite the seventy-four-year effort of communism 
                        to promote atheism, 25 percent of the people still adhere to Russian Orthodox Christianity. 
                        While approximately 60 percent of Russians were nonreligious when the communist regime fell, 
                        Christianity and Orthodoxy are experiencing a mild revival. Among the non-Russian populations, 
                        Islam and Buddhism are widespread. The official state religion is Russian Orthodoxy, 
                        which enjoys a privileged position with the government. About 75 million Russians belong to 
                        that faith, but fewer than half of that number are considered active worshippers. The fastest 
                        growing religion is Islam, professed by about 20 million, a much higher percentage of whom are 
                        considered active participants. Other religions are Roman Catholicism, 1.3 million; Judaism, 
                        between 400,000 and 550,000; and Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses, 131,000. Religious activity increased 
                        markedly following the collapse of communist rule in 1991, but restrictions have remained for 
                        certain groups. A 1997 law set requirements that religions be registered, putting unrecognized 
                        groups at a disadvantage. For example, all Muslim groups falling outside the government-
                        sanctioned Spiritual Directorate of Muslims of Russia are repressed as potential terrorist 
                        organizations. </p>
                    <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:justify">Religions (estimates are of practicing worshipers): 
                        Russian Orthodox 15-20 percent, Muslim 10-15 percent, other Christian 2 percent (2006 est.). 
                        Russia has large populations of non-practicing believers and non-believers, a legacy of over 
                        seven decades of Soviet rule. In 1996 about 75 percent of believers in Russia considered 
                        themselves Russian Orthodox, 19 percent Muslim, and 7 percent other. Religious activity 
                        increased sharply in post-Soviet period, given official government and constitutional 
                        sanction. The 1993 Russian constitution guarantees religious freedom and states all religions 
                        are equal before the law. Article 14 of the 1993 constitution stipulates that "the Russian 
                        Federation is a secular state. No religion may be established as the state religion or a 
                        compulsory religion. Religious associations are separated from the state and are equal before 
                        the law." However, such a constitutional guarantee existed even during the Stalinist era, 
                        when religious oppression was at its worst. In the 1990s, the Russian citizenry has shown 
                        that the traditional, deeply felt linkage between Russian Orthodoxy and the Russian state 
                        remains intact. That linkage has a palpable effect on Russian secular attitudes toward 
                        religious minorities, and hence on the degree to which the new constitutional guarantee of 
                        religious liberty is honored.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:justify">Few Russians are considered strongly religious. 
                        Many grew up when atheism was state policy and churches were architecture and art museums. 
                        Russian Orthodox Christianity is credited more with establishing cultural bonds than saving 
                        souls. It is estimated that less than 5 percent of Russians regularly attend church. 
                        In tsarist Russia there was a one church for every 1,000 people. Today, there are one for 
                        every 80,000 people. In 1989, only 40 percent of the Soviet Union citizens said they believed 
                        in God. Atheism was the state religion of the Soviet Union. It was a prerequisite to 
                        membership to the Communist Party. Members of religious groups were effectively excluded.</p>
